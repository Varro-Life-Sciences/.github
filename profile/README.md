### **Pioneering Disease Prevention Technology**

Our purpose is to disrupt disease transmission. We develop innovative products and technologies that make a global impact across economic and cultural borders. We are ambitious and dedicated in our pursuit to leverage technology that saves lives, ensures safe environments, and prevents future pandemics.

## **Why partner with Varro?**

The probability of another pandemic like COVID-19 is estimated to be as high as 76%\* in the coming decades. The increasing likelihood of future pandemics makes early detection and prevention crucial. Pathogens don’t stop at borders. This work won’t either. We partner with academics, public health organizations, and technologists around the globe to provide superior pathogen detection and to advance disease prevention. This technology is designed to be at the forefront, providing rapid, accessible, and reliable pathogen detection capabilities. Our work has three product offerings: 

**Increased awareness of airborne pathogens development and transmission**

We are working on the design of a micro-immunoelectrode (MIE). The nanobody-based electrochemical biosensor serves as a critical early warning tool by enabling real-time detection of breath-based and  airborne pathogens. In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, its ultra-sensitive detection capability can identify as few as ten viral particles within 20 seconds, enabling rapid response to potential outbreaks before they spread. The design is customizable to accommodate new pathogen detection within 4 weeks of identification. 

**Equipping individuals with diagnostic testing**

A breath-based diagnostic to detect respiratory pathogens in under 60 seconds is a significant advancement for detection. This key piece of technology will utilize the MIE and eventually an associated database for real-time tracking of pathogen transmission. This empowers individuals and communities alike to be well informed and proactive in protecting threats. 

**Providing indoor real time pathogen monitoring**

The air bio-detector system's ability to simultaneously detect multiple pathogens through its multiplexed design makes it an essential tool for protecting vulnerable populations in shared indoor spaces. Healthcare facilities, daycare centers, and other indoor environments struggle to protect themselves in the face of unidentified airborne pathogens. This tool will provide critical data for vulnerable populations to protect those who inhabit those spaces.
